        <h2 id="1">What are digital products?</h2>
<p>A digital product is an intangible asset or piece of media that can be sold and distributed repeatedly online without the need to replenish inventory. These products often come in the form of downloadable or streamable digital files, such as MP3s, PDFs, videos, plug-ins, and templates.</p>
<h3>Why sell digital products versus physical goods?</h3>
<p>Digital products have many advantages that make them uniquely attractive to sell:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Low overhead costs.</strong>You don’t have to hold inventory or incur any shipping charges.</li>
<li>
<strong>High profit margins.</strong> There’s no recurring cost of goods, so you retain the majority of your sales in profits.</li>
<li>
<strong>Potential to automate.</strong> Orders can be delivered instantly, letting you be relatively hands-off with fulfillment.</li>
<li>
<strong>Flexible products.</strong> You can offer free products to build your email list, monthly paid subscriptions for access to exclusive digital content, or licenses to use your digital products. You have a lot of options as to how you incorporate digital products into your business.</li>
<li>
<strong><strong>E-learning is the future of education. </strong></strong>You have a massive opportunity to expand your business and impact with e-learning, an industry expected to be worth <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/17/2146962/0/en/Global-E-learning-Market-Size-Trends-Will-Reach-USD-374-3-Billion-by-2026-Facts-Factors.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20research%20study,14.6%25%20from%202019%20to%202026." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$374 billion by 2026</a><strong>.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But digital products also come with specific challenges you’ll need to watch out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>You’re competing with free content.</strong> With digital goods, consumers can probably find free alternatives to what you’re selling. You’ll have to think carefully about the niche you target and your <a href="/blog/8211159-9-simple-ways-to-write-product-descriptions-that-sell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">product descriptions</a>, offer high-quality products, and know <a href="/blog/8211159-9-simple-ways-to-write-product-descriptions-that-sell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to build your brand</a> in order to compete.</li>
<li>
<strong>You’re susceptible to piracy/theft.</strong> You need to take precautions and reduce these risks by employing the right tools to protect your products.</li>
<li>
<strong>There are some restrictions on how you sell.</strong> For example, you must sell physical products through the Facebook and Instagram sales channel according to their <a href="https://help.instagram.com/1627591223954487" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">commerce policy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these challenges can be overcome, however, if you employ the right tools when designing your digital product business.</p>
