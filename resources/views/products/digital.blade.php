            <h2 id="1">What are digital products?</h2>
            <p>A digital product is an intangible asset or piece of media that can be sold and distributed repeatedly online
                without the need to replenish inventory. These products often come in the form of downloadable or streamable
                digital files, such as MP3s, PDFs, videos, plug-ins, and templates.</p>
            <h3>Why sell digital products versus physical goods?</h3>
            <p>Digital products have many advantages that make them uniquely attractive to sell:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Low overhead costs.</strong>You don’t have to hold inventory or incur any shipping charges.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>High profit margins.</strong> There’s no recurring cost of goods, so you retain the majority of
                    your sales in profits.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Potential to automate.</strong> Orders can be delivered instantly, letting you be relatively
                    hands-off with fulfillment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Flexible products.</strong> You can offer free products to build your email list, monthly paid
                    subscriptions for access to exclusive digital content, or licenses to use your digital products. You
                    have a lot of options as to how you incorporate digital products into your business.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><strong>E-learning is the future of education. </strong></strong>You have a massive opportunity
                    to expand your business and impact with e-learning, an industry expected to be worth <a
